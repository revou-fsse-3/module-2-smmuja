## My Bio
```
Hi, Im Muja, an aspiring Software Engineer
Currently working as a Customer Success Specialist in a web hosting company
```
![Muja Photo](assets/img/muja.jpg)

Coming from a non-tech background, I learn everything I need on the job, and realizing it won't satisfy my aspiration since I need to balance my own goals and company business goals, I decided to pursue another learning journey outside work. After thoughtful consideration of several possible options, RevoU became my choice.
